### #!/usr/bin/env node

#!/usr/bin/env node is an instance of a shebang line: the very first line in an executable plain-text file on Unix-like platforms that tells the system what interpreter to pass that file to for execution, via the command line following the magic #! prefix (called shebang).

Note: Windows does not support shebang lines, so they're effectively ignored there; on Windows it is solely a given file's filename extension that determines what executable will interpret it. However, you still need them in the context of npm.[1]
