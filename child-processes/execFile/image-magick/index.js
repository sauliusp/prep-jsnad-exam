/*Having execFile is great for when you want to just execute an application and get the
output (or discard it), for example, if you want to run an image-processing command with ImageMagick and
only care if it succeeds or not. But if an application has a lot of output or you want to do more real-time
analysis of the data returned, using streams is a better approach.*/
